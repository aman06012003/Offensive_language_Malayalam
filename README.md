# Offensive_language_Malayalam
This is an Machine learning model used to identify spam words in Malayalam. The dataset is basically of tweets from different accounts.
The Random Forest Classifier works really good in this type of data and gives about 74% accuracy as it is a long dataset.
Moreover for data cleaning I used many NLP techniques like vectorization, lemmatization etc. 
Also I have removed emojis from the tweets as a part of data preprocessing.
